# Security Policy

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

At **Next Chat** ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"), we are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data handled by our AI chat application ("Service"). This Security Policy outlines the security measures, technical controls, and operational procedures we employ to safeguard systems and data against unauthorized access, misuse, and disclosure.

This policy applies to all users, systems, and personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the Service.

---

## 1. Data Classification and Handling

We classify data to determine appropriate handling procedures and protection levels:

- **Public Data**: Data intended for public access.
- **Internal Data**: Operational data used internally but not confidential.
- **Confidential Data**: Includes personal data, authentication credentials, and sensitive content exchanged through the chat interface.
- **Restricted Data**: Highly sensitive data that requires the highest level of protection.

All user-generated content is treated as Confidential or higher by default.

---

## 2. Data Encryption

We employ industry-standard encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest:

- **In Transit**: All communications between clients and servers are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **At Rest**: Sensitive data is stored using AES-256 or equivalent encryption standards.

Access to encryption keys is restricted and managed using secure key management infrastructure (KMS).

---

## 3. Access Controls

We implement strict access control measures across all systems:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access based on the principle of least privilege;
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative access;
- Session timeouts and automatic logout for inactivity;
- Audit logging of privileged actions and access attempts.

---

## 4. Application Security

Next Chat is developed using secure coding practices aligned with industry standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10):

- Input sanitization and output encoding to prevent injection attacks;
- Rate limiting and CAPTCHA enforcement to mitigate automated abuse;
- Strict API authentication and authorization mechanisms;
- Regular static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST);
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs).

---

## 5. Infrastructure and Network Security

Our infrastructure is hosted on reputable cloud service providers with robust security controls:

- Segregated environments for development, staging, and production;
- Firewall rules and virtual network segmentation;
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS);
- Continuous monitoring of system logs and network traffic;
- Patching and vulnerability remediation in accordance with defined SLAs.

---

## 6. Incident Response and Breach Notification

We maintain a formal **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** that includes:

- Identification, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures;
- Timely investigation of all security events and alerts;
- Notification to affected users and relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations;
- Post-incident reviews and root-cause analysis.

---

## 7. Data Retention and Disposal

Data retention is governed by business requirements and legal obligations. Upon expiration of the retention period or at the request of the user:

- Data is securely deleted using cryptographic erasure or equivalent methods;
- Backups containing personal or confidential data are destroyed in accordance with secure disposal practices.

---

## 8. Third-Party Security

We assess all third-party vendors and subprocessors for compliance with applicable security standards before integration:

- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) are executed as necessary;
- Vendors must implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards;
- Third-party services are monitored for uptime, integrity, and data handling compliance.

A list of subprocessors is available upon request.

---

## 9. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

We maintain documented Business Continuity (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) plans:

- Regular backups and off-site replication of critical systems and data;
- Defined Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO);
- Annual testing of recovery procedures and failover capabilities.

---

## 10. Security Awareness and Training

All employees and contractors receive security training during onboarding and at regular intervals, covering:

- Data handling and protection protocols;
- Threat detection and reporting procedures;
- Social engineering awareness;
- Secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices for technical staff.

---

## 11. Compliance and Auditing

We conduct regular internal audits and security assessments to ensure compliance with this policy and applicable regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001):

- Annual risk assessments;
- Penetration testing by qualified third-party providers;
- Audit logs are maintained for system access, configuration changes, and data operations.

---

## 12. Reporting Vulnerabilities

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you believe you have discovered a security issue, please report it via:

**Security Contact Email:** [Insert Security Email]  
**PGP Key (if applicable):** [Insert PGP Public Key URL]  
**Bug Bounty Program (if applicable):** [Insert URL or details]

We will investigate all valid reports and respond in a timely manner.

---

## 13. Policy Updates

We may update this Security Policy to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal obligations. Changes will be communicated via our website or through in-app notifications.
