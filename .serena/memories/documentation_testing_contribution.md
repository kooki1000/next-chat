# Documentation, Testing, and Contribution Guidelines

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add inline comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior
- Use JSDoc-style comments for functions and components
- Document public APIs and hooks with clear descriptions of parameters, return values, and examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date when making changes

### Project Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes to project structure or setup
- Document new features or breaking changes
- Include usage examples for new components or APIs

## Testing

### Testing Approach

- Test core functionality and critical user journeys
- Focus on testing business logic and data flow
- Test synchronization between local and cloud data
- Test offline functionality and resilience

### Types of Tests

- Unit tests for utility functions and isolated components
- Integration tests for connected components and data flow
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Contribution Guidelines

### Contribution Workflow

1. Create a new branch from main with a descriptive name
   - `feature/<name>` for new features
   - `fix/<name>` for bug fixes
   - `refactor/<name>` for code refactoring
2. Make changes following the project's code style and conventions
3. Run tests and ensure code quality
4. Create a pull request with a descriptive title and explanation
5. Address feedback and iterate

### Pull Request Standards

- Clear, concise title describing the change
- Detailed description of the changes, reasoning, and impact
- Reference any related issues or discussions
- Include screenshots or videos for UI changes
- Ensure all checks pass (linting, type checking, tests)

### Code Review

- Be respectful and constructive in code reviews
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards
